RandomProject
=============

I took an interest in learning C++ development just for fun of it. The RandomProject which includes my huge C++ Project that I am currently working on my gap year and hoping to finish by February 2015. 

Hoping to keep updated my code every week, so people are able to learn and hopefully the community can also give me back some tips and advices in improving my code.

I have started this project at 20 September 2014.

The game is highly influence in Runescape and in future I am going to be changing names to avoid copyright fragments. As for now, all the names of weapons and skills are just placeholder until I find original names.

Current Tasks
=============
+ Improve bow damage algorithm
+ Improve weapon damage algorithm
+ Add item id 
+ Finish all user related projects (Creating Account, Login, etc...)
